# Clock Of Clocks

### A digital clock with seconds, minutes and hours made up of many small analogue clocks that sync up to act as the display.

After my teacher showed me pictures of digital clocks made up of the hands of dozens of tiny analogue clocks, I wanted to try an program a version of it.

This is a simple proof of concept of that. It shows the time based on the user's system time. There is also a stopwatch feature I added for a bit of fun that has start, stop and reset features.
